Xinhang Xie
+ resolved merge conflicts rather quickly
+ good communication, we asked each other for help for jenkins setup
+ we took on tasks that were related to what we did in sprint 1, assigned tasks to the right person

- we shouldve asked dennis for help more often when he was available
- we shouldve pulled more often from repo to make sure everybody was on the same page
- should've only worked during meetings so we can have an estimate on how much story points can be completed in a sprint

Oscar L Correa
+ moved quickly, straight to point
+ task assigned to right merson

Wenlong Wang
+ good communication
+ helped each other in jenkins setup

- spend a lot of time in jenkins setup and create maven project
- should pull from repo before merge
